						<h2>I love music</h2>
						<p>
						Music has always been a huge part of my life, whether I listen to it alone or with other people. I explore a wide range of genres, from classical to pop, jazz to electronic, and many more, each offering its own unique experience. Any kind of activity involving music, such as creating playlists, going to concerts and parties helps me feel connected to my feelings and to the people around me. It lifts my mood and make moments special.

						<h2>I like travelling a lot</h2>
						<p>
							Travelling since a very young age has made me curious about the world and eager to discover different cultures and experiences. I love to travel and explore different places, which has taught me how to adapt and be flexible in new situations. These trips help me to be more open-minded and create precious memories.

						<h2>I like horse riding</h2>
						<p>
							Horse riding is a thrilling activity that I have enjoyed for many years. The experience of creating a bond between rider and horse requires patience, trust and understanding, teaching valuable life skills. This sport gives me a sense of freedom and harmony. It is not just a hobby, it is a passion that strengthens my love for animals.
